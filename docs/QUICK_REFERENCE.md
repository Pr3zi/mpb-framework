# MPB Quick Reference

**Mind → Paper → Building** with stage gates.

- **Mind gate**: 2‑line goal, audience+value, end‑to‑end logic (no gaps).
- **Paper gate**: diagram/outline, tool stack + POC validated, key risks mitigated.
- **Building gate**: build matches plan, monitoring + rollback ready, no open unknowns.
