## **End-to-End Client Acquisition & Onboarding Automation for Coaches & Consultants (with Mental Models)**

---

### **Stage 1 – Mind**

**Goal:** Create a fully automated process that takes a prospect from initial inquiry to being fully onboarded and ready for their first coaching session — with zero manual intervention.

**Why:** Saves time, ensures a consistent client experience, and reduces the risk of losing prospects due to delays or missed steps.

**Logic:**

- Trigger: A prospect fills out a “Book a Discovery Call” form on the website.
- Action: Automatically schedule a call, add them to CRM, send pre-call prep materials.
- Outcome: Client is onboarded with all information they need before the first session.

**Key Questions:**

- What is the *minimum* information we need to collect in the form?
- Which onboarding materials must every client receive before their first call?
- Where could delays or errors occur in this flow?

**Mental Models Applied:**

- **First Principles Thinking** – Reduce the process to essentials: lead form → schedule → CRM entry → onboarding emails.
- **Inversion** – Ask: “If this funnel failed, what are the top 5 causes?” (e.g., missed follow-ups, tech errors, poor form design).
- **Pareto Principle (80/20)** – Focus on the 20% of onboarding actions that deliver 80% of the client’s clarity before the first call.

### **Stage 2 – Paper**

**Diagram:**

1. **Trigger** – Form submission from Book Like a Boss/Calendly.
2. **Scheduler** – Auto-confirmation & calendar booking.
3. **CRM Entry** – Add lead to Notion/HubSpot with all form data.
4. **Pre-Call Email** – Send agenda, Zoom link, and pre-call questions.
5. **Onboarding Packet** – Deliver PDF or Notion client guide.
6. **Follow-Up Reminder** – Send reminder 24h before call.
7. **Automation Logs** – Track in Google Sheet for backup.

**Tools:** Book Like a Boss, Calendly, N8N, Notion/HubSpot, Google Sheets, Gmail/Outlook.

**POC:** Test the flow with one “fake” lead to ensure every step runs without manual touch.

**Bottlenecks:**

- Calendar conflicts or double-booking.
- Email going to spam.
- CRM field mapping errors.

**Mental Models Applied:**

- **Bottleneck Principle** – Identify potential blockers (calendar sync, spam filters).
- **Critical Path Method** – Arrange tasks in the exact order to ensure no step is skipped.
- **Red Team Thinking** – Try to “break” the flow by testing wrong inputs, typos, and missing data.

### **Stage 3 – Building**

**Setup in N8N:**

- **Trigger node:** Webhook from Book Like a Boss/Calendly.
- **CRM node:** Create lead entry in Notion or HubSpot.
- **Email node:** Send pre-call materials.
- **File delivery node:** Share onboarding guide via Notion link or cloud storage.
- **Scheduler node:** Add follow-up reminders.
- **Logging node:** Append lead data to Google Sheet.

**Test:** Run at least 5 different test submissions with varied data.

**Add:** Error handling for failed emails, duplicate prevention for CRM.

**Mental Models Applied:**

- **Feedback Loops** – Test reminder and onboarding delivery with a colleague before going live.
- **Checklist Manifesto** – Verify each node is configured (API keys, fields, links) before launch.
- **Premortem Analysis** – Imagine the system fails after a week; list likely causes and fix them now.

**✅ Quick Exit Criteria:**

- Every new lead automatically appears in the CRM.
- Clients receive pre-call and onboarding materials without delay.
- You spend zero minutes manually adding leads or sending onboarding emails.
