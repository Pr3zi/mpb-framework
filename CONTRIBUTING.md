# Contributing Guide

Thanks for considering a contribution!

## Ways to contribute
- Report a bug (Issue)
- Propose an improvement (Issue)
- Open a Pull Request (PR) with a fix or doc update
- Share an example workflow (add to `examples/`)

## Workflow
1. Open an Issue describing the problem or proposal.
2. Fork the repo and create a feature branch: `feat/<short-name>` or `fix/<short-name>`.
3. Make changes with clear commits (we suggest Conventional Commits, e.g., `feat: add client onboarding example`).
4. Open a PR linking the Issue. The PR template will guide you.
5. Address review comments; weâ€™ll squash-merge when ready.

## Style
- Keep README sections concise and actionable.
- Prefer Markdown for docs.
- Ensure examples follow the MPB structure (Mind, Paper, Building + Mental Models).
